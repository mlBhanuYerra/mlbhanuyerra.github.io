### Introduction

### Approach


#### Dataset


#### Model Steps
The data processing and modeling involved a number of steps, each with variations as shown below:
1. Vectorization:
- Count vectorization
- <i><b>TF-IDF</b></i> (term frequency - inverse document frequency)
2. Dimensionality Reduction/Topic-Modeling
Reduced vectorized matrices from step 2 to a 10-dimensional space.
- <i><b>Latent Semantic Analysis (LSA)</b></i>
- Non-negative Matrix Factorization
- Latent Dirichilet Allocation


A number of tools and technologies were used in performing these steps and they include:
- Python
- Sci-kit learn
- Pandas
- Surprise, Python's Recommendation System Engine
- NLTK (Natural Language ToolKit)

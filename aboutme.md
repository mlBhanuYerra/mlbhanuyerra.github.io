My name is Bhanu Yerra. An engineering consultant by title but really a coffee addict by day and Netflix addict by night. Love to cook, workout, dream, travel, read, listen to music, just the usual stuff.

Seattle - India - Pacific Northwest

Curious about machine learning and artifical intelligence.
